									My school is very grand having three storeys impressively structured building and located in the centre of city.
									It is situated around 3 km from my home and I go to school by bus. My school is one of the best schools in the state I live.
									It is located at very peaceful place without any pollution, noise and dust.
									School building has two staircases at both ends which lead us to every floor. It has well equipped and big library,
									well instrumented science lab and one computer lab at first floor. At ground floor there is a school auditorium where all the annual functions,
									meetings, PTM, dance competitions takes place.

									Principal office, head office, clerk room, staff room and common study room are located at ground floor. The school canteen, stationery shop,
									chess room and skating hall are also located at ground floor. My school has two big cemented basketball courts in front of the school principal
									office while football field lies in the side of it. My school has a small green garden, in front of the head office, full of colourful flowers
									and decorative plants which enhance the beauty of the entire school complex. Around 1500 students have taken admission in my school. They
									always rank higher in any inter-school competitions.<br><br>

									The study norms of my school are very creative and innovative which helps us in understanding
									any tough matters very easily. Our teachers teach us very sincerely and tell us everything practically.
									My school ranks first in any programme like inter-school cultural pursuits and sports activities.
									My school celebrates all the important days of the year such as Sports Day, Teacher’s Day, Parents’ Day, Children’s Day,
									School Anniversary Day, Founder’s Day, Republic Day, Independence Day, Christmas Day, Mother’s Day, Annual function, Happy New Year, Mahatma Gandhi Birthday, etc
									in a grand manner.<br><br>

									We participate in the co-curricular activities such as swimming, scouting, N.C.C., school band,
									skating, singing, dancing, etc. Students having unfair behavior and undisciplined activities are
									punished by the class teacher as per the school norms. Our principal takes classes of every student
									daily in the meeting hall for 10 minutes to deal with our character formation, etiquette, moral education,
									acquiring good values and respecting others. Our school time is very interesting and enjoyable as we do lots
									of creative and practical works daily. Our oral assessment of storytelling, singing, poem recitation, conversation in Hindi
									and English is taken by the class teacher on daily basis.
									So, my school is the best school of the world.<br><br>
